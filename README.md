This repository demonstrates a common bug in Solidity smart contracts: uninitialized state variables. The `balanceOf` function in the `ERC20Token` contract attempts to access the `balances` mapping without initializing it.  This leads to unpredictable results, potentially allowing for incorrect balance reporting and vulnerabilities. The solution demonstrates proper initialization of the mapping in the contract's constructor.
